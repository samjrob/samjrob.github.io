    <h1>Sam Roberts' Assignment 5: High Voltage & Transistors!</h1>
    <div class="header">

      <p>Here is all the documentation for High Voltage & Transistors! This assingment I was tasked with 
        builting a circuit that uses a transistor to control a seperate power load with a seperate input sensor. 
        I used capacitive sensor and and LED strip to create a touch lamp!

      This is the schematic for the circuit. The schematic has two distinct parts. The capacitive sensor (left) which 
      serves as the input for the circuit, and the high voltage transistor (right) resticts or allows current to flow through the LED strip. 
      The capacitive sensor ustilizes a 1 M ohm resistor. The resistance value determines how sensitive the sensor is, 
      with a high value such as 1 M lowering the sensitivity to requiring touch. If a lower value was used the capacitive 
      sensor would activate as the hand got close to the half a capacitor. The transistor is wired with a 12 volt power supply 
      and an LED strip beofre it. Pin 9 is used as the control for the transistor. Then the entire circuit is then grounded. When 
      pin 9 is supplyng current the transistor allows curretn to flow through the LED strip, turning it on. The led strip is made up 
      of roughly 1000 segements (5m total length / 0.05m segemnt length). Each segment has 3 white LEDs and one 180 ohm resistor. Since 
      all segements are in series the voltage in each segment is equal to 12 V. White LEDs have a V drop of 3.3, to total drop is 9.9, 
      meaning the current is (2.1 / 180) which equals about 11.7 mA in each segment. Since there are 1000 segements that means the total 
      current into the transistor is 11.7 A<br>
      Below is an image of the circuit.

      The circuit is divided up into two main parts, the capacitive sensor, which serves as the input to control 
      the high voltage transistor which allows or blocks current to flow through the LED strip. The capacitive sensor uses pin 4 as the sendPin and 
      pin 2 as the recievePin. There is a 1 Megaohm resistor inbetween the two pins. On the pin 2 side of the resistor there 
      is a penny that is aligator clipped to a wire which acts as part of the capacitor. The LED strip is wired from power from the 
      outlet, through the transistor, and then grounded on the blue bar with the rest of the circuit. Pin 9 is used as direct input 
      to control the transistor.
