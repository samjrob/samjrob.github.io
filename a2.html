    <h1>Sam Roberts' Assignment 2: Fade!</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="fadegif.gif" />
      <p>Here is all the documentation Blink! I was assigned to build and code an Arduino circuit that
        would cause multiple LEDs to light up when a button is pressed, with at least one of the LEDs
        behavior being fading on and off.

      This is the schemattic for the circuit. Pin 2 is set to INPUT and pins 3, 4, and 10 are set to output. 
      When the button is closed current flows from power towrds pin 2 and ground, since the current has to 
      either pass through a 10k ohm resisitoror go towrds pin 2, almost all of the curretns flows towrds pin 2 since there is way less resistance. For the 3 LEDs, pins
      3, 4, and 10 all emit 5 volts so an appropiate resistor is used to limit the current to at or below 
      20 mA. The red and green LEDs have a voltage drop of 1.8 so a 220 ohm resisitor is used. The blue 
      LED has a drop of 3.2, so a 100 ohm resistor is used. Ohms law was used to calculate these values. 
      Below is an image of the circuit.

      The button part of circuit receives voltage from power on the Arduino board. A blue wire branches
      off after the button into pin 2, and a black wire goes to ground placed after a resistor. For the
      three LEDs, they are all connected to either pin 3, 4, or 10 by a red wire. They are in line with
      either a 220 ohm or 100 ohm resistor (depending on the voltage drop of the LED) to reduce the current.
      All three LEDs are then connected to the blue grounding bar on the breadboard by black wires, 
      which is connected to the ground on the Arduino board.

    <p>
      Assuming only the LEDs are drawing current, a 1200 mAh battery could power my circuit for about 
      25.5 hours. This is because the red and green LEDs drain 14.5 mA each (3.2/220), and the blue LED
      drains 18 mA (1.8/100). This means the circuit in total drains 47 mA. A 1200 mAh battery can supply
      1200 mA for one hour, so it can supply 47 mA for at least 25.5 hours (1200/47).
