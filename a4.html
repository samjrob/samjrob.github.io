      <p>Here is all the documentation Libraries! For this assignment I was tasked to utilized 2 external 
        Arduino Libraries. The final circuit was required to utilize an input part and an output part, where 
        the value of the input affects the behavior of the output. My circuit uses CapacitiveSensor as the input 
        and Servo as the output.

    <p>
      This is the schematic for the circuit. The schematic has two distinct parts. The capacitive sensor (left) which 
      serves as the input for the circuit, and the servo motor (right) which uses movment as the output of the circuit. 
      The capacitive sensor ustilizes a 1 M ohm resistor. The resistance value determines how sensitive the sensor is, 
      with a high value such as 1 M lowering the sensitivity to requiring touch. If a lower value was used the capacitive 
      sensor would activate as the hand got close to the half a capacitor. The servo motor only requires power, ground, and 
      a signal, so those are supplied through the power and ground ports on the Arduino, and the signal comes from pin 9.<br>
      Below is an image of the circuit.

      The circuit is divided up into two main parts, the capacitive sensor, which serves as the input for the circuit, 
      and the servo motor which acts as the output through movement. The capacitive sensor uses pin 4 as the sendPin and 
      pin 2 as the recievePin. There is a 1 Megaohm resistor inbetween the two pins. On the pin 2 side of the resistor there 
      is a penny that is aligator clipped to a wire which acts as part of the capacitor. The servo motor is wired directly into 
      power and ground, and connected to pin 9 as the signal pin

      2. An erroneous reading would be one that varies drastically from the reading before and after it. To check 
      if a reading is erroneous and should be thrown out a histroy of three readings will be kept, the previous, current, 
      and next readings. Prevoius is the last value read andw will start at 0, current is the first signal read, and next is the output of
      a second read. Current will be checked if it is close in value to either previous or next, and if it is, the current value becomes 
      prevoius and is sent out, and next becomes current. If it is not close it can be assumes either current or next is an erroneous 
      reading and both will be disreagarded and two new measurments will be taken. Current could be the erroneous reading since it did not 
      land close to the other two measurments, or it could be next since not passing could be the result of next being wrong and giving 
      current an unfair check. <br>

      3. In order to address the unpredictable inaccuracy in the sensors measurments I would implement in my code an 
      average of sensory readings to be the one that is outputted: a for loop that iterates from 4 times, and inside the 
      loop an int varible called sum_readings is += to the current reading, then after the for loop sum_readings is divided 
      by four. This finaal oaverage of readings is then mapped and constrained and sent as the output. This would address 
      the noise because it is likley that that there are values above and below the true reading, and by averaging them you 
      arrive at a value inbtween them, which is likley not too far off the true value. The circuit would be slightly less 
      responsive because 4 inputs is one output but it would reduce the noise of the readings.
