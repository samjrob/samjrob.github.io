    <h1>Sam Roberts' Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>
    <div class="header">

      <p>Here is all the documentation for Blink! I was tasked to create and code a circuit in which at least 3 LEDs could blink independantly.</p>

    <img src="blinkschematic.jpg" />
    <p>This is the schematic for the circuit. Each of the pins (P7, P8, P9) emit 5V when actvated. All three LEDs have a votalge drop of 1.8V.
      In order to limit the current to be around 20 mA, each LED is paired with a 220 Ohm resistor. This is because V = I * R, so
      (5 - 1.8) = 0.02 * R results in R = 160. Therefore the ideal resistor to reach 20 mA of current is 160 Ohms, but since the kit I used does
      not have a resisitor of that value, I used the next closest one of a greater value, since that would guarantee that the current at least
      will not exceed 20 mA. Below is an image of my circuit.
