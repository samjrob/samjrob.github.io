    <h1>Sam Roberts' Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="blink.gif" />
      <p>Here is all the documentation for Blink! I was tasked to create and code a circuit in which at least 3 LEDs could blink independantly.</p>

    <p>This is the schematic for the circuit. Each of the pins (P7, P8, P9) emit 5V when actvated. All three LEDs have a votalge drop of 1.8V.
      In order to limit the current to be around 20 mA, each LED is paired with a 220 Ohm resistor. This is because V = I * R, so
      (5 - 1.8) = 0.02 * R results in R = 160. Therefore the ideal resistor to reach 20 mA of current is 160 Ohms, but since the kit I used does
      not have a resisitor of that value, I used the next closest one of a greater value, since that would guarantee that the current at least
      will not exceed 20 mA. Below is an image of my circuit.
    </p>

    <p>The three LEDs are all powered with their own indivdual red wire, which connects to either pin 7, 8, or 9.
      Every LED is in line with a 220 Ohm resistor which comes before the LED in the circut, although it would
      still work if the resistor was after the LED. All three LED circuits are connected to the interconnected blue bar
      at the edge of the bread board, and the blue bar is then connected to the ground of the Arduino.

    <p> If you utilized all 14 digital pins on the Arduino you could have 13 different LEDs blink independantly. The amount
      of current that this would draw would be equal to #LEDs that are on times (5 - voltage drop) / resisitance. Assuming
      it was all red LEDs with resistors matching the ones I used (1.8 voltage drop and 220 Ohms), if all 14 happened to be 
      on at the same time the circuit would be drawing 204 mA of current, which would be the maximum amount it could draw.
      <br>
      <br> Putting the delay for turning off an LED and then turning on an LED to 3 milliseconds is when I could no longer
      tell that the lights were blinking. At 5 and 10 milliseconds the lights appeared to be slightly flickering, but 3 was
      the longest I could set the delay and still not be able to tell.
