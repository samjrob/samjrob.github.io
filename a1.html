    <h1>Sam Roberts' Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <img src="blink.gif" />
      <p>Here is all the documentation for Blink! I was tasked to create and code a circuit in which at least 3 LEDs could blink independantly.</p>

    <img src="blinkschematic.jpg" />
    <p>This is the schematic for the circuit. Each of the pins (P7, P8, P9) emit 5V when actvated. All three LEDs have a votalge drop of 1.8V.
      In order to limit the current to be around 20 mA, each LED is paired with a 220 Ohm resistor. This is because V = I * R, so
      (5 - 1.8) = 0.02 * R results in R = 160. Therefore the ideal resistor to reach 20 mA of current is 160 Ohms, but since the kit I used does
      not have a resisitor of that value, I used the next closest one of a greater value, since that would guarantee that the current at least
      will not exceed 20 mA. Below is an image of my circuit.

      // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
      void setup() {
      // initialize digital pins 7, 8, 9 as an output.
      pinMode(red, OUTPUT);
      pinMode(green, OUTPUT);
      pinMode(blue, OUTPUT);
    }

    // the loop function runs over and over again forever
    void loop() {
      digitalWrite(7, HIGH);  // turn the 7 pin LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
      delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
      digitalWrite(7, LOW);   // turn the 7 pin LED off by making the voltage LOW
      delay(1000);                      // wait for a second 
      digitalWrite(8, HIGH);  // turn the 8 pin LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
      delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
      digitalWrite(8, LOW);   // turn the 8 pin LED off by making the voltage LOW
      delay(1000);                      // wait for a second 
      digitalWrite(9, HIGH);  // turn the 9 pin LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
      delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
      digitalWrite(9, LOW);   // turn the 9 pin LED off by making the voltage LOW
