      <p>Here is all the documentation Input/Output! This assignment utilizes a voltage divider and 
        analogRead/Write to create a circuit which reacts to the enviroment around it. My circuit uses 
        a photoresistor to detect brightness. As it gets dimmer around the photoresistor the output of 
        the pins also decreases. The display shows 4, 3, or 9 (HCDE 439) depending on how dark it is around the 
        photoresistor.

    <p>
      This is the schematic for the circuit. My circuit utilizes the a seven segment display to show numbers 
      but only six of the segments are needed to display 4, 3, and 9, so only 6 of the segments LEDs are 
      wired. A voltage divider is used as a means of getting readable input from the photoresistor. As it gets 
      darker around the photoresistor and its resisitance increases, the A0 pin reads lower values of voltage after the first resistor.
      A 10k resistor is used because it roughly matches the max resistance of the photoresistor, which will then give the voltage divider 
      conisistent values between roughly 5 and 2.5V. The letters next to each diode are the letters associated with specific LEDs on the display
      For each of the red LEDs they are all wired in series with a 220 ohm resistor to limit the current to close to 20 mA 
      (3.2/0.02). All LEDs are grounded through the grounding prong of the seven segment display. <br>
      Below is an image of the circuit.

      All of the pins are wired into the seven segment display through an in series resistor to limit the current into the LEDs. All 
      of which are then grounded through the top gorunding prong and connected to the blue grounded bar. The voltage divider reads the 
      voltage between the photoresistor and a 10k resisitor through the blue wire. The divider is also grounded through the blue bar
      which is connected to ground on the Arduino. The divider is powered with 5 volts from the Arduino board.

      1. For a voltage divider to work the varible resistor can be either R1 or R2. The equation
      for V out (R2 / (R1 + R2)) * V in shows that the voltage out is just the percentage of total resistance from R2 times 
      the input voltage. If we had 5 volts in and R1 of 50 and R2 of 50, the equation would give 50/100 * 5 = 2.5, which 
      makes sense since R2 is 50% of the resistance and V in is 5. If R1 is varible and becomes 100, R2 is now only 33%
      of the total resistance so V out = 1.65. Now if R2 is varible and becoems 100 it accounts for 66% of the resisitance
      and V out is 3.3. Either resistor can be varible but it important to keep track of how the relationship between the 
      readings and the resistance changes depending on which is varible.

      3. Changing the bits would change the range at which the values have to be mapped. Increasing the bits means that the 
      numbers can lay in a bigger range. So instead of map(analogRead(A0), 0, 1023, 0, 255) for 8 and 10 bit values, we would 
      have to write map(analogRead(A0), 0, 65536, 0, 1023) for 10 and 16 bit values.
